# Competitive Programming
I will be documenting every problems that I could solve and no :p this did not come from leetcode or hackkerrank (kekw)

# Problems
Will be creating different folders inside this repository and it will be sorted into Easy-Medium and Hard with proper transcriptions so that this may also serve as a learning material.

# Further Contributions
I would also start creating problems that I saw in Fourier Transforms on my previous Advanced Maths class that has a pattern and may be implemented in Python, hopefully I'd get things done and be able to contribute to either leetcode or hackerrank! wish me luck.
